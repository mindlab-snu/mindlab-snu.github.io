### Current Projects
<hr>

#### Core machine intelligence algorithms

We primarily focus on overcoming the limitations of the current supervised machine learning framework. The first category we focus on is the **adaptive machine learning (AML)** schemes that deal with more challenging scenarios without large-scale labelled training data. The examples of those schemes include _continual learning, meta/transfer learning, and self-supervised/unsupervised learning_. The second focus category is the **trustworthy machine learning (TML)** methods that make ML models more reliable and safe to use. Namely, we pursue to make ML algorithms more _explainable, fair, bias-free, and robust_. 

Some more concrete funded project regarding above topics includes the following:
- Next generation continual learning (Supported by [NRF]() (2021-2026), [IITP]() (2022-2027), [US AFOSR](https://www.afrl.af.mil/AFOSR/) (2023-2025) )  
- XAI with causality / Robust XAI / Few-shot learning (Supported by [IITP]() (2022-2027))  
- Fairness in machine learning (Supported by [IITP](https://www.iitp.kr/en/main.it) (2019-2022)) 
- Hyperscale AI / Multimodal learning (Supported by [Naver](https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic) (2021-2024))  
- Fair continual learning (Supported by [LG AI Research](https://www.lgresearch.ai/kor/) (2022-2023))
- Continual reinforcement learning (Supported by [SAIT](https://www.sait.samsung.co.kr/saithome/main/main.do) (2022-2025))

#### Data science applications

For applications, we aim to apply the ML algorithms to solve a **real-world problems** that can lead to a **high impact**. Some of the recent topics include _multi-modal model inference, neuroscience / medical image analyses, semiconductor random variation prediction, image restoration, radar-based activity recognition, satellite-based PM2.5 estimation_, etc. 

Some recent funded projects include the following:
- Deep learning based battery management (Supported by [Hyundai Motors](https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/)) (2023-2024)
- Neuroscience / Medical data analyses / Brain decoding (Supported by [NRF]() (2021-2023, 2023-2028))
